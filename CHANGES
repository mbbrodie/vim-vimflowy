Per the requirements of the Artistic License 2.0, here are the changes to the original narrow.vim script:
- Add global list variable to serve as a stack. When calling Narrow(), we push a dictionary containing PRE/POST blocks onto the stack. This allows repeated calls to Narrow() -- unlike the original version. Calls to Widen() will pop a data dictionary off the stack in LIFO order.
- Add function to auto-select an area based on indentation. 
- Map ']' to Narrow() and '[' to Widen() functions.
- Saving at any level of focus unwraps and saves the entire document.

We include a number of other helper shortcuts for folding or jumping files, but these are described in the README and not part of the current plugin implementation.
